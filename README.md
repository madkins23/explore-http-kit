# exlore-http-kit

FIXME: description

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/madkins23/explore-http-kit/tree/master

## Usage

You could build a standalone jar but I usually:

    lein run

or

    lein run all

## Options

The sub-tests can be run with the following names:

* `simple`
* `nested`
* `chain`
* `multi`
* `my`

For example:

    lein run simple chain

## Description

This Clojure program explores the way `http-kit` callbacks and threads interact.
See the `intro.md` file for more detail.
