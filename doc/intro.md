# Introduction to explore-http-kit

See: http://www.http-kit.org/

After beating my head against a wall for some days in an enterprise-level
system using `http-kit` I finally wrote this code to figure out how it worked
(and why it sometimes did not). This is a fairly narrow exploration,
concentrating on callback handers and why the sometimes block.

There is only a single program in `expore-http-kit.explore-thread-use`.
It contains a series of "tests" that demonstrate some quirks and solutions.

The following sections discuss the various tests:

## `simple`

## `nested`

## `chain`

## `multi`

## `pool`
